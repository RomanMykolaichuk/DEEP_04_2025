    "Her outer shell is made of matte smart-alloy plating with glowing seams of soft blue or violet light, subtly pulsating in sync with her activity.\n",
    "Her face is smooth and expressive, made of flexible nanomaterial allowing minimal facial expressions — gentle eyes with adaptive LED pupils that change color depending on mood (blue = neutral, green = encouraging, amber = analytical).\n",
    "Around her temples, fine silver lines flow into a translucent holographic headband that projects subtle data visuals — math formulas, maps, or student profiles.\n",
    "Design Elements:\n",
    "Her chest plate displays a holographic badge with an open book and a brain icon — symbolizing the fusion of knowledge and AI.\n",
    "Fingers are slender and jointed, with embedded laser pointers and touch sensors for precise board writing and digital interface navigation.\n",
